# 🔐 Password Generator & Strength Checker

This project is a command-line based Password Generator and Strength Checker built with Python. It allows users to create secure, randomized passwords tailored to their preferences, including options for length, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. Once generated, the password is evaluated and categorized as Weak, Medium, or Strong based on its composition.

Designed as a beginner-friendly project, this tool demonstrates key Python programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and the use of built-in modules like `random` and `string`. It’s ideal for learners looking to strengthen their coding fundamentals while building something practical and secure.

The project is lightweight, easy to use, and extendable — future improvements may include a graphical user interface, clipboard support, or password storage with encryption. Whether you're a student, aspiring developer, or looking to build your portfolio, this project is a great starting point.
